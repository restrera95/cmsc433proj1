Here's what I'm thinking for the files we need.
We will move project1.html to project1.php.
----------
Main Files:

project1.php:
	User inputs info and classes

	Validate info
	-once valid:
		go to result.php

result.php:
	Display classes
		-Maybe put their list of classes in an array?
		-Check each class in S1-S8 (see below) in order and if not in array, add to an array of classes for them to take?

	Insert student and student_courses to database
-----------
Supplementary Files:

mystyle2.js:
	Validation only allowing students to select courses they have prereqs for.

mystyle.css
	Styling

createtables.php:
	Creates tables (only run once)

insertcourses.php
	Insert courses (only run once)
