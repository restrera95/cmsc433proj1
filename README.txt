First, go into your database and create a database named mydb.

Next run createtables.php, and then run insertcourses.php.

Those files only need to be run once, in order to create the tables and insert all courses.

NOTE: The SQL steps are optional. If you are not able to get it working, it will not affect the code otherwise.

Now you can go ahead and run project1.html and fill out the form.
